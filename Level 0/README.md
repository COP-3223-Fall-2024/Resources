# Hello There

If you didn't read that in Kenobi's voice, and call yourself a star wars fan, please check yourself.

## Real Talk

With that jab out of the way, you might be here thinking to yourself any of the following:

- I don't know how to code!
- How does one make programs?
- Do I need to be good at math?
- This is too much and I don't know if I'll be good enough

Okay anxiety, relax. If you're here, I can assure you so are many others. While you might not see them, I do (no seriously, I can see web traffic and insights how many times a file has been opened lol). 

## Initial Steps

Let's start with the basics. You will be coding in this class in one programming language (called C) and there are several out there. You might ask "why did we go from Python (if you did COP2500) to C" or "why not another language"? 

Well its because of the Foundation Exam that UCF loves to do. It's in C and that's why we're here. 

I would recommend to the reader to get acquainted with the difference between an IDE (integrated development environment) vs a text editor. 

Since we are using C, there will be two terms that are used consistently throughout the course. Compilation vs execution.

Compilation is when the code is compiled or how I describe it as packaged/crammed into a single file so it can be read by the computer. 

Execution is the process of reading that single file to actually see **output** or the result of your code.

### IDE

Okay, an IDE is what many of you might be using in this class. and that's okay (I highly recommend against getting comfortable here though).

An IDE will do alot of the background setup and heavy lifting for you. It is able to recognize the language you're coding in and provide suggestions/advice before the code is actually compiled.

Essentially, an IDE will compile **and** execute for you. This will help you get stuff done but hold you back on learning what happens underneath the hood. So please understand that.

### Text Editor

A text editor is the exact opposite of an IDE. It does neither the compilation or execution for you. 

I suggest this not to make you suffer but many languages have different methods of compilation and execution and frankly, you do not want to be tied to a single IDE for every single language.

Let me put it in perspective, imagine being tied to a different device for business/school/or gaming respectively. It becomes burdensome and at some point, you might want to consolidate.

A text editor is the foundation and gives you the flexibility to do all that. Example, I can code Python/C/Java file on a text editor but I cannot code a C file in an IDE for Python. 

Regardless, a compiler needs to be setup and I know having a compiler stuck to an IDE is awful in industries with multiple languages. Typically you just code in text editors and use IDE's to speed up that process because of their advice (which is becoming redundant due to AI and features like Copilot). 

## Recommended Software 

For IDEs, I suggest the following. Bear in mind, since they compile and execute, they are more **bloated** than text editors:

- Code::Blocks
- Dev-C++

For text editors, I suggest the following:

- VSCode
  - I recommend this one the most. VSCode provides so many extensions that essentially converts itself to a lightweight IDE if done correctly 
- Notepad++
- Vim/Emacs
