# Overview

Welcome! I'm sure this will be very much overwhelming to those who have no idea what they signed themselves up to and very in-line to those who have some experience with *programming*.

I will try to take this slow and provide ample detail so you will succeed in this class but more importantly, in your career as a CS student.

So please read through this and take all resources I provide to you as a means of self-development and piquing your curiousity. 

## Starting Point

Well, where should we start? Let's start with why you might be here and I'll take a moment to be honest with you. 

CS, or professionally refer to as Computer Science, is such a broad field that no amount of education can prepare you for everything that the field offers. I, uh, actually mean that.

CS offers the following fields, which is just a fraction of what you can do:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- Bioinformatics
- Computational Biology
- Cybersecurity
- you get the point.

My reasoning in stating this is simple, do not be mislead by expecting what you learn in school to be **sufficient enough** to prepare you for any given sub-field. 

You will need to put in substantial amount of work outside of class and face several __conflicting__ advice whether you want to stay in let's say software engineering vs cybersecurity. My takeaway, do what you will enjoy and **never forget to ask for help**. 

## Next Steps

Alright! Now on to the actual stuff this repository will be about. I will provide several resources to help you get started in CS here in the form of links, text files, etc. 

Feel free to go within each folder and ask questions or provide more resources (trust me, I do not have all the answers and you might know more in certain topics). This is a space for everyone to help each other get started. 

**Disclaimer**: I am heavily biased towards Software Engineering and Game Engine development as that is my current industry experience. So, I apologize in advance if that's not what you want or I am eager to answer any questions you have regarding it.
